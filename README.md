# Overview
This website was created as a project for COP 4331C - Processes of Object Oriented Software Development, at the University of Central Florida. Per instructions, it uses a LAMP-based stack, and is hosted using Digital Ocean and GoDaddy. The website acts as a contact manager, allowing users to create accounts, sign in, and add, edit, or delete contacts from their record list.

# File Structure
Within the repo, there are two folders: documentation, and html. The documentation folder is simple- it contains all of the documents, diagrams, and images created for the presentation, as well as the presentation itself and a demonstration of the API working via SwaggerHub.


The html folder contains multiple subfolders: 
- LAMPAPI/, which contains the various php files that allow the database to be updated;
- css/, which contains styles.css, a stylesheet which dictates the design of the entire website;
- images/, where the background and logo for the website are stored
- js/, which acts as the logic of the website.
- Besides the subfolders, it also contains contacts.html and index.html. Index is the page you start on when launching the website, and contacts is the page you are directed to after signing in.
